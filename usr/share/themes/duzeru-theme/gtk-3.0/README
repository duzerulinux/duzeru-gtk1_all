* Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and process them with SASS (run 
  `/.parse-sass.sh` when you have the required sofwtare installed, as described below)

* To be able to use the lates/adequate version of sass, install ruby and get the sass gem via bundle. 
  This is done with `gem install bundle && bundle install` from the same directory this README resides in.

You can read about SASS at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/. Once you make your changes to any .scss file, you can either run the ./parse-sass.sh script or keep SASS watching for changes as you
edit. This is done by running `bundle exec sass --watch --sourcemap=none .` If sass is out of date, or is
missing, you can install it with `bundle install`.
